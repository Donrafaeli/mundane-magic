## Mundane magic

I have begun to discover the importance of noticing and preserving little things. Human moments, inconsequential tiny details, boring ecstasy. They make me smile and remind me that magic is always within reach. I must remember. This is a way - a catalog of mundane magic. Highly subjective, but probably not as much as I think.
